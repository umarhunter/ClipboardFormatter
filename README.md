# Welcome to ClipboardFormatter!
### Link to Repl.it: -- unavailable until 1st stable build -- 
### **Objective**: Create a C++ program that is light-weight (for portability) and retrieves non-formatted user data and creates a formatted representation of said data. Accomplishes this using advanced C++ techniques like classes, recursive functions, inheritances, etc. 

###### Note from the Programmer: I originally came up with this idea working at my 9-5 College Assistant job. I ran into an issue where I would have to copy large datasets and paste it in to a massive email chain. The issue with this was that Excel still contains errors when copying massive cells, and there would be strange symbols that get added in, thus ruining the hope of sending the mass email swiftly. I decided that I can probably apply my computer science knowledge to create a solution to this. Clipboard Formatter was the end result, and I hope it can help anyone who works at an office and encounters the same issue. Let's be honest, who **_wants_** to get into Excel macros for such a trivial task? 

###### WARNING: THIS PROGRAM IS NOT INTENDED FOR PROFESSIONAL USE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET FOR THIS TASK.

### Current Version: 2
Features:
* cleaned up code (removed unnecessary functions, variables, etc)
* added function to check if identical elements (emails) exist to prevent potential spam
* added a print function
* added function that checks for empty emails
* user settings! (this took some massive investment and time)

#### Previously Completed:
Version 1:
* Contains necessary classes and functions (does not have to be complete)
