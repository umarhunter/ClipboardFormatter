### **Objective**: Create a C++ program that is light-weight (for portability) and retrieves non-formatted user data and creates a formatted representation of said data. 

###### Note from the Programmer: Working in the office, I would have to copy large datasets and paste it in to massive email chains. The issue with this was that Excel still contains errors when copying numerous cells, and there would be strange symbols that get added in, thus ruining the hope of sending the mass email swiftly. I decided that I can probably apply my computer science knowledge to create a solution to this. Clipboard Formatter was the end result, and I hope it can help anyone who works at an office and encounters the same issue. Let's be honest, who **_wants_** to get into Excel macros for such a trivial task? 

###### WARNING: THIS PROGRAM IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES. USE AT OWN RISK.
